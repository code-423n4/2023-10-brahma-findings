# BYTES CONSTANT MORE EFFICIENT THAN STRING LITERAL

Unless explicitly required, if the string is lesser than 32 bytes, it is recommended to use bytes32 constant instead of a string constant as itâ€™ll save some gas.

# ABI ENCODE IS LESS EFFICIENT THAN ABI ENCODEPACKED

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/ConsoleFallbackHandler.sol#L85-L85

The contract is using abi.encode() in the function isValidSignature. In abi.encode(), all elementary types are padded to 32 bytes and dynamic arrays include their length, whereas abi.encodePacked() will only use the minimal required memory to encode the data.

Unless explicitly needed , it is recommended to use abi.encodePacked() instead of abi.encode().

# SPLITTING REQUIRE STATEMENTS
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeEnabler.sol#L48-L48
Require statements when combined using operators in a single statement usually lead to a larger deployment gas cost but with each runtime calls, the whole thing ends up being cheaper by some gas units.

It is recommended to separate the require statements with one statement/validation per line.

# FUNCTION SHOULD BE EXTERNAL
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeEnabler.sol#L43-L56
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeEnabler.sol#L66-L75

A function with public visibility modifier was detected that is not called internally.
public and external differs in terms of gas usage. The former use more than the latter when used with large arrays of data. This is due to the fact that Solidity copies arguments to memory on a public function while external read from calldata which a cheaper than memory allocation.

If you know the function you create only allows for external calls, use the external visibility modifier instead of public. It provides performance benefits and you will save on gas.

Developers can save around 10 opcodes and some gas if the constructors are defined as payable.
However, it should be noted that it comes with risks because payable constructors can accept ETH during deployment.

It is suggested to mark the constructors as payable to save some gas. Make sure it does not lead to any adverse effects in case an upgrade pattern is involved.
# INTERNAL FUNCTIONS NEVER USED
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/PolicyValidator.sol#L174-L176
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/libraries/SafeHelper.sol#L63-L78

The contract declared internal functions but was not using them in any of the functions or contracts.
Since internal functions can only be called from inside the contracts, it makes no sense to have them if they are not used. This uses up gas and causes issues for auditors when understanding the contract logic.

Having dead code in the contracts uses up unnecessary gas and increases the complexity of the overall smart contract.
It is recommended to remove the internal functions from the contracts if they are never used.

# CHEAPER INEQUALITIES IN IF()
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/PolicyValidator.sol#L116-L116
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/PolicyValidator.sol#L162-L162

The contract was found to be doing comparisons using inequalities inside the if statement.
When inside the if statements, non-strict inequalities (>=, <=) are usually cheaper than the strict equalities (>, <).

It is recommended to go through the code logic, and, if possible, modify the strict inequalities with the non-strict ones to save ~3 gas as long as the logic of the code is not affected.

# PUBLIC CONSTANTS CAN BE PRIVATE

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeModeratorOverridable.sol#L21-L21

Public constant variables cost more gas because the EVM automatically creates getter functions for them and adds entries to the method ID table. The values can be read from the source code instead.

If reading the values for the constants are not necessary, consider changing the public visibility to private.

SLOADs are expensive (100 gas after the 1st one) compared to MLOAD/MSTORE (3 gas each).

Storage variables read multiple times inside a function should instead be cached in the memory the first time (costing 1 SLOAD) and then read from this cache to avoid multiple SLOADs.
