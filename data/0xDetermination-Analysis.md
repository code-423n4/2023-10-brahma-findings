# Brahma Console Analysis
## Approach
The audit process started with a review of account deployment functionality, focused on the SafeDeployer contract and relevant associated contracts such as AddressProvider, WalletRegistry, and PolicyRegistry. The second step was a review of sub account integrations, mostly focused on the contracts mentioned above. The final step was a review of executor functionality, including the signing verification mechanism. This step focused on the SafeModerator, TransactionValidator, and PolicyValidator contracts, along with associated library integrations.
## Architecture
The architecture of the contracts is overall well-designed and secure. Although there is risk resulting from functions allowing arbitrary user inputs, the state changes generally depend on the `msg.sender` or the provision of a valid signature. As a result, the possible attack vectors are quite limited, and none related to this concern were discovered over the course of the security review. In addition to this attack-limiting design, the immutability of already-set addresses in the AddressProvider contract reduces centralization risks associated with changing core protocol functionalities. Finally, replay vulnerabilities are always a concern when signatures are used, but the developers have taken this into account; no such issues were found in this review.
## Potential Improvements
Console account deployment in the SafeDeployer contract could be access controlled so that only an approved sender is able to conduct console deployments. Currently, anyone can conduct console deployments for any other users; it may be safer to impose more restrictions on this functionality.

As a style suggestion, combining the SafeModerator, TransactionValidator, and PolicyValidator contracts into a single contract could improve code readability.
## Test Coverage
The test coverage is quite comprehensive, although more tests for edge cases might help to provide greater security assurances.
## Conclusion
The architecture of the codebase is very secure, and potential attack vectors are limited. The code clarity and commenting is very high quality. Reading the codebase and test cases, it's clear that the developers are mindful of security; very few issues were found during this review.
