## Impact
The issues related to gas consumption and transaction failure. The impact includes:

- Excessive Gas Costs: The vulnerability may result in significantly higher gas costs for transactions, potentially leading to inefficient use of computational resources.
- Transaction Failures: Due to excessive gas consumption, transactions may run out of gas and fail, leaving intended operations incomplete and user experiences disrupted.

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeDeployer.sol#L229-L224

```Solidity
// Generate nonce based on owners and user provided salt
uint256 nonce = _genNonce(ownersHash, _salt);
do {
    try IGnosisProxyFactory(gnosisProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(gnosisSafeSingleton, _initializer, nonce)
    returns (address _deployedSafe) {
        _safe = _deployedSafe;
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        // KEK
        if (keccak256(bytes(reason)) != _SAFE_CREATION_FAILURE_REASON) {
            // A safe is already deployed with the same salt, retry with bumped nonce
            revert SafeProxyCreationFailed();
        }
        emit SafeProxyCreationFailure(gnosisSafeSingleton, nonce, _initializer);
        nonce = _genNonce(ownersHash, _salt);
    } catch {
        revert SafeProxyCreationFailed();
    }
} while (_safe == address(0));
```

## Recommended
Gas Limit Threshold: Define a threshold for the gas limit to prevent excessive gas consumption. If the threshold is exceeded, the transaction should be reverted or gracefully halted, avoiding unnecessary gas costs.

```Solidity
// Generate nonce based on owners and user provided salt
uint256 nonce = _genNonce(ownersHash, _salt);
do {
+   // Check if the safe creation fails due to gas exhaustion
+   require(nonce < MAX_NONCE, "Gas exhaustion: Increase gas limit or use a new salt");

    try IGnosisProxyFactory(gnosisProxyFactory).createProxyWithNonce(gnosisSafeSingleton, _initializer, nonce)
    returns (address _deployedSafe) {
        _safe = _deployedSafe;
    } catch Error(string memory reason) {
        // KEK
        if (keccak256(bytes(reason)) != _SAFE_CREATION_FAILURE_REASON) {
            // A safe is already deployed with the same salt, retry with bumped nonce
            revert SafeProxyCreationFailed();
        }
        emit SafeProxyCreationFailure(gnosisSafeSingleton, nonce, _initializer);
        nonce = _genNonce(ownersHash, _salt);
    } catch {
        revert SafeProxyCreationFailed();
    }
} while (_safe == address(0));
```
