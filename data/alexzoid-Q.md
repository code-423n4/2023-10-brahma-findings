## `ConsoleFallbackHandler` inheritance from `IFallbackHandler`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/interfaces/external/IFallbackHandler.sol
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/ConsoleFallbackHandler.sol#L20

The `ConsoleFallbackHandler` contract does not appear to directly inherit from the `IFallbackHandler` interface. This omission could lead to compatibility issues or unintended behavior, especially if the contract doesn't implement the necessary methods specified in the interface.

It is recommended that the `ConsoleFallbackHandler` contract directly inherits from the `IFallbackHandler` interface:

```solidity
import {IFallbackHandler} from "interfaces/external/IFallbackHandler.sol";

contract ConsoleFallbackHandler is AddressProviderService, DefaultCallbackHandler, ISignatureValidator, IFallbackHandler { 
```

## Sort `_owners` in `_createSafe` in order to get deterministic addresses

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/SafeDeployer.sol#L219

The function `_createSafe` in `SafeDeployer` contract is responsible for creating new `Gnosis Safe` contracts. A vital point in the creation process is the generation of a unique nonce that is based on the owners' addresses and a provided salt. However, for the resulting Safe addresses to be deterministic across different networks, it's essential that the owners' addresses list be consistent in its order. Currently, the function does not guarantee the consistent order of the `_owners` array, leading to the possibility of generating different Safe addresses on different networks for the same set of owners.

It is recommended sorting the `_owners` array before hashing or using it in any calculations. Possible fix:

```solidity
function _createSafe(address[] calldata _owners, bytes memory _initializer, bytes32 _salt)
    private
    returns (address _safe)
{
    // Sort the _owners array
    _sortAddresses(_owners);

    address gnosisProxyFactory = AddressProviderService._getAuthorizedAddress(_GNOSIS_PROXY_FACTORY_HASH);
    address gnosisSafeSingleton = AddressProviderService._getAuthorizedAddress(_GNOSIS_SINGLETON_HASH);
    bytes32 ownersHash = keccak256(abi.encode(_owners));

    // ... [rest of the code remains unchanged]
}

function _sortAddresses(address[] memory addrs) private pure {
    uint256 length = addrs.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
            if (addrs[j] < addrs[i]) {
                address temp = addrs[j];
                addrs[j] = addrs[i];
                addrs[i] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conditional validation based on transaction success in `validatePostTransaction` function

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/TransactionValidator.sol#L105-L107

The method `validatePostTransaction` checks the security configuration of the `subAccount` regardless of the success of the transaction. This can lead to unnecessary gas consumption and checks when the transaction was not successful.

It is recommended adding a conditionally check the `subAccount` security configuration only if the transaction was successful:

```solidity
function validatePostTransaction(bytes32 txHash, bool success, address subAccount) external view {
    if (success) {
        _checkSubAccountSecurityConfig(subAccount);
    }
}
```

## Consistent ownership verification in `ExecutorRegistry` contract

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/registries/ExecutorRegistry.sol#L40
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/registries/ExecutorRegistry.sol#L55

The `ExecutorRegistry` contract uses two different methods to check if a `_subAccount` is owned by the `msg.sender`. In the `registerExecutor` function, the `isOwner` function is called from the `WalletRegistry` contract. However, in the `deRegisterExecutor` function, the `subAccountToWallet` mapping is accessed directly. Using two different methods for ownership verification may lead to inconsistencies.

In `registerExecutor`:
```solidity
if (!_walletRegistry.isOwner(msg.sender, _subAccount)) revert NotOwnerWallet();
```

In `deRegisterExecutor`:
```solidity
if (_walletRegistry.subAccountToWallet(_subAccount) != msg.sender) revert NotOwnerWallet();
```

It is recommended using the `isOwner` function consistently. Replace the ownership verification in `deRegisterExecutor`:
```solidity
if (!_walletRegistry.isOwner(msg.sender, _subAccount)) revert NotOwnerWallet();
```

## Zero address check in `registerExecutor` function

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-brahma/blob/main/contracts/src/core/registries/ExecutorRegistry.sol#L38-L44

The `registerExecutor` function in the `ExecutorRegistry` contract does not check if the `_executor` parameter is the zero address. Allowing the zero address in contracts can introduce unexpected behaviors.

It is recommended adding a validation step at the beginning of the `registerExecutor` function to ensure that `_executor` is the zero address. 
```solidity
function registerExecutor(address _subAccount, address _executor) external {
    require(_executor != address(0), "Executor address cannot be zero");

    WalletRegistry _walletRegistry = WalletRegistry(AddressProviderService._getRegistry(_WALLET_REGISTRY_HASH));
    if (!_walletRegistry.isOwner(msg.sender, _subAccount)) revert NotOwnerWallet();

    if (!subAccountToExecutors[_subAccount].add(_executor)) revert AlreadyExists(); 
    emit RegisterExecutor(_subAccount, msg.sender, _executor);
}

```
