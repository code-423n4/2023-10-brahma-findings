## [02] Analysis of the codebase

- The codebase of Brahma is well-structured, with clear rules for different parts of the system
- The roles of various accounts like `Console`, `Subaccount`, `Executor`, and governance are well-defined, making it easy to understand who does what
- The codebase appears **very secure** and lacks obvious bugs; it makes use of secure and well-known frameworks such as Gnosis Safes
- The codebase quality is **very high**, well-documented, and follows the best industry practices
- Test quality is **high**. It is recommended to add some fuzzing tests to cover more corner cases

## [03] Architecture feedback

- The system allows easy integration of already existing contracts, permitting users to import any type of contract as a console account
- The use of well-defined guard contracts (`SafeModerator` and `SafeModeratorOverridable`) adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that transactions comply with established policies
- The use of registries, such as `ExecutorRegistry`, `PolicyRegistry`, and `WalletRegistry`, enhances modularity and flexibility, increasing the separation of concerns
- The use of Gnosis Safes as console accounts and subaccounts enhances the security aspect, as they are known to be very secure

## [04] Centralization risks

There are several centralization risks:
- Governance is supposed to be private and owned by Brahma. It is recommended to use a DAO instead, allowing users to decide and improve the protocol's decentralization
- Governance can modify several important parameters (e.g., adding authorized addresses, adding new registries...)

## [05] Systemic risks

There are several systemic risks:
- It's important to ensure compatibility between all versions of Gnosis safes for console accounts, as any version could be imported, instead of being created through `SafeDeployer`
- Governance can set important parameters but cannot remove them. In case they have bugs or are malicious, the system will be harmed as a whole
- It's recommended to ensure that Subaccounts can't exploit any loopholes to subsidize their permission through the non-obvious use of Gnosis Safe features
