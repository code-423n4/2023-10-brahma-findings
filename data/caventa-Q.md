Currently, SafeDeployer#deployConsoleAccount does validate the number of threshold values. In the context of multi-signature wallets, a "threshold" refers to the minimum number of signatures required to execute a transaction or perform some action. Hence, the threshold should be less than or equal to the length of the owners. I would suggest changing SafeDeployer#deployConsoleAccount

```diff
function deployConsoleAccount(address[] calldata _owners, uint256 _threshold, bytes32 _policyCommit, bytes32 _salt)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (address _safe)
{
+   require(_threshold <= _owners.length, "Threshold cannot be greater than number of owners");

    bool _policyHashValid = _policyCommit != bytes32(0);

    _safe = _createSafe(_owners, _setupConsoleAccount(_owners, _threshold, _policyHashValid), _salt);

    if (_policyHashValid) {
        PolicyRegistry(AddressProviderService._getRegistry(_POLICY_REGISTRY_HASH)).updatePolicy(
            _safe, _policyCommit
        );
    }
    emit ConsoleAccountDeployed(_safe);
}
```
