The lack of validation for `msg.sender` (validating whether msg.sender is a valid gnosis safe account or not) at `registerWallet()` function in `WalletRegistry.sol` allows any Externally Owned Account (EOA) or smart contract to register itself as a wallet without verification:

This absence of verification gives the registered wallet in previous step 2 more options:
1) Policy Updates: registered wallet can call the updatePolicy() method in PolicyRegistry.sol, which enables them to register a commit for their account.

2) Unrestricted Sub-Account Deployment: registered wallet can deploy a sub-account using the deploySubAccount() method.

Recommended Mitigation:
Implement a verification mechanism in the registerWallet() function to ensure that only Gnosis Safe wallets can register.
